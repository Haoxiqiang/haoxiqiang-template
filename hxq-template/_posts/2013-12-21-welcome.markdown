def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi,STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

$$ 
\begin{aligned} \dot{x} &= \sigma(y-x) \\ 
\dot{y} &= \rho x - y - xz \\ 
\dot{z} &= -\beta z + xy \end{aligned} 
$$

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) $ and they are
